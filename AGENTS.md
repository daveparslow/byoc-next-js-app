# AGENTS Instructions for Vibe Coding with Next.js

This repository uses **Next.js** with **TypeScript** and **HeroUI**. Keep the energy up and follow these conventions when working here.

## Development
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Start the dev server with `npm run dev`.
- Run linting and formatting with `npm run lint` before committing.
- Run tests with `npm run test -- --run` before committing.
- If `node` or `npm` cannot be found, locate them with `which node`/`which npm` and use the absolute path.

## Commit Messages
- Write short, presentâ€‘tense commit messages (e.g. `add navbar` or `fix layout`).
- Keep the first line under 72 characters.

## Style
- Formatting is handled by Prettier via the ESLint config. Do not override these rules.
- Write React components using TypeScript and functional components.

## Coverage
- Do **not** modify any coverage exclude lists (e.g. `.nycrc` or other configuration files) under any circumstances.

## Other Notes
- Do not alter `.npmrc` or `.gitignore`.
- Keep the project on the latest Next.js best practices.
